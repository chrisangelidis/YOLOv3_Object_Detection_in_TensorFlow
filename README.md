# YOLOv3_Object_Detection_in_TensorFlow
This repository contains an implementation of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) for object detection using TensorFlow. YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm that can detect multiple objects in an image and provide their bounding boxes and class labels.

## Overview
The YOLOv3 algorithm is a state-of-the-art object detection model that achieves high accuracy while maintaining real-time performance. It processes the entire image in a single pass and produces bounding boxes and class predictions directly. This makes YOLOv3 very efficient and suitable for real-time applications such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and more.

## Key Features
- Implementation of YOLOv3 in TensorFlow.
- Pretrained weights for the COCO dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset can be foung in the following Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aruchomu/data-for-yolo-v3-kernel)
## Results
After running the object detection scripts, the detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes and labels. The results can be visualized on images or saved as processed videos.
